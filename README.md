Inspired by my daily work in diabetes, this is a personal project titled: "Simulating Patient Behavior in Diabetes Care: Insights from Digital Twin Technology". Using the python programming language, I will create a digital twin that stimulates key lab metrics in diabetes management as well as key behavioral measures used to study and improve the health of diabetics.
